## Partially implemented / foundation laid

| Area | Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Collaboration | Comments / notes | 🟡 | Not yet built |
| RBAC | Role-aware access control | 🟡 | UI structure can support it later |
| Alerts | Threshold-based notifications | 🟡 | Metrics surfaces are in place |

## Recommended next additions

- annotation / incident-notes layer
- prompt and policy version diffing
- RBAC with route guards
- simulation / dry-run mode
- threshold-based alerting on metric surfaces
